# Horiseon-Accessibility

## Making the Horiseon webpage more accessible and refactoring the code

The Horiseon webpage is (mostly) functional, but certainly needed a few tweaks. My mission was to make the page more accessible by giving alt atributes to the images and icons on the page, to eliminate some repetitive code by consolidating some of the css text, and to amp up the design slightly.  The 'Search Engine Optimization' link in the <nav> section was not working properly, and an addition to the HTML resolved that issue promptly. Other than that the website did work just fine. However, as mentioned, there were several instances in the css file where repetitions were made and I was able to condense some selectors onto one line and the list of properties only appear once. The last changes I made were to the website itself. I kept the colorscheme similar and adjusted some of the blues and grays as well as adding borders to places where I felt it would increase the design quality. Additionally, I added rounded edges to the <aside> element and the <article> elements. Lastly, I added plenty of commentary to the CSS file to describe exactly what was being done to the website line by line.
